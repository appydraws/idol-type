      You decide that you're too late to worry about a glowing object in your bag. The concert is about to begin, and you sprint to the venue. You make it just in time, but the main entrance is a sea of people. To your left, you see a small, empty side gate. Huh...

        Must be something unrelated, let's wait at the main gate

        Why's the side gate unattended? I kinda want to see what's there
