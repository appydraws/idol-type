      You decide to stay. The band continues their soundcheck, but now they're playing just for you. It's an intimate, unforgettable experience. Afterward, the group hands you a signed, exclusive poster, with a note saying: "We hope you enjoyed the pre-show, but please keep this a secret". As you take leave for the main event, you can feel the energy of the main concert space.
